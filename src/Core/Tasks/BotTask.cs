///     ascending/descending time order (matches the original mission-dispatch behavior), while Warfront Campaign is an
///     unrelated level-50 sub-feature (war machines) with its own loot/daily-mission tasks - grouping
///     them together would hide that they're functionally unrelated beyond sharing a screen.
