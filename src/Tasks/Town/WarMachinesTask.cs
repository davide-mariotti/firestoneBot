///     War Machines (https://firestone-idle-rpg.fandom.com/wiki/War_Machines) leveling - the user
///     asked for a level-up logic here too, after Hall of Heroes. Per the wiki: leveling a war
///     machine costs Expedition Tokens plus 3 components (Screw/Cog/Metal, obtained passively from
///     jewel chests, auto-distributed across owned machines by the game itself) for +100 xp: "level
///     bonus = 1.05^(level-1) - 1", a flat multiplicative boost to all of that machine's attributes.
///     Live-confirmed, 2026-09-18: the level-up button's own clickable state does NOT reliably predict
///     real affordability - clicking it while short on Expedition Tokens pops the game's generic
///     "CurrencyMissing" warning instead of silently failing (same issue as Tree of Life's personal
///     upgrades - see CurrencyMissingPopup), so this stops the whole task as soon as that appears
///     instead of hitting the same wall on every remaining machine (Expedition Tokens are a single
///     currency shared across all of them, per the wiki).
///     Runs across every owned war machine (WarMachines.Machines), not just the 5 in the active
///     battle formation - unlike Hall of Heroes' gear T1, the wiki gives no indication that leveling
///     a benched machine is wasted (components are already auto-balanced across ALL owned machines by
///     the game itself, favoring newly unlocked ones), so there's no similar reason to scope down.
///     Screen has 3 other tabs not covered here - "garage" (read-only stats, no action at all),
///     "blueprintUpgrades" and "rarityUpgrades" (separate wiki mechanics: per-attribute currency
///     spend and big rarity-tier jumps respectively) - out of scope for "level up", not requested.
