/// <summary>
///     Spends Arcane Crystals on Awakening (Guild -&gt; Awakening) - claimed via the Mailbox task
///     (SystemMailTask) since the wiki lists Arcane Crystal rewards as mail deliveries, then spent
///     here. Level 50 gate per the wiki. This whole feature is new, requested by
///     the user.
///     No selection logic needed at all: per the wiki, the awakened hero is chosen randomly by the
///     game itself, weighted toward heroes with a lower awakening level (catch-up mechanism similar
///     to Sacred Cards) - nothing for this task to decide there.
///     Per the user ("cercando di usare il moltiplicatore il più possibile"): always re-selects the
///     biggest currently-usable multiplier (x160 down to x1, x1 always available) before every single
///     awaken, not just once at the start - the multiplier only affects cost/xp proportionally (no
///     actual efficiency gain per the wiki), so this is purely about spending crystals in as few
///     clicks as possible, and re-picking each time naturally steps down to a smaller multiplier once
///     the bigger one is no longer affordable instead of stalling out early.
