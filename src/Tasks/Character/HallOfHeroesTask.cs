/// <summary>
///     Hall of Heroes (https://firestone-idle-rpg.fandom.com/wiki/Hall_of_Heroes) gear/jewel
///     management - the user asked to design this from scratch
///     ("come proponi di muoverci con una logica?"), grounded in the Gear wiki
///     (https://firestone-idle-rpg.fandom.com/wiki/Gear) and the Jewels wiki
///     (https://firestone-idle-rpg.fandom.com/wiki/Jewels), plus the external tips guide already
///     used for Firestone/Meteorite Research.
///     Covers, for every hero in the roster:
///     - Gear tier unlock: T2 (Wrist/Shoulder/Belt) and T3 (Ring/Relic), each gated on both hero
///       power and Meteorites per the wiki - both enforced by the game itself via the unlock
///       button's own clickable state, same as every other gated action in this codebase
///       (PharaohsVault, Awakening, Tree of Life), so no threshold values are hardcoded here.
///     - Gear enchanting: T2/T3 slots always, since their bonus applies to ALL heroes per the Gear
///       wiki's Bonuses table; T1 (Weapon/Chest/Boots) only for heroes currently in the active
///       battle formation (Party screen), since it only benefits the hero wearing it - per the
///       user's explicit choice ("squadra attuale, dinamico") over a fixed hero list, resolving the
///       tension between the tips guide's "concentrate on a few core heroes" and this codebase's
///       usual spread-evenly default. Active-formation membership is read from the separate "Party"
///       screen (GameModel/Features/Character/Party.cs) by index, since neither Party's roster nor
///       Hall of Heroes' own roster exposes a readable hero name to cross-check by - both are
///       ASSUMED to list heroes in the same order (same underlying data, two different screens),
///       not independently verified live. If T1 enchanting turns out to target the wrong heroes,
///       start there.
///     - Jewel enchanting: all 6 slots (Ankh/Rune/Idol T1, Talisman/Necklace/Trinket T2), every
///       hero unconditionally. The Jewels wiki says a jewel's bonus only applies "when the hero is
///       in its crew" (a War Machine), which would argue for the same active-only scoping as gear
///       T1 - but unlike Void Crystals, Ethereal Shards have no other use per the wiki, so there's
///       no opportunity cost being protected by narrowing the target set, and the War Machine crew
///       screen hasn't been investigated. Revisit if this turns out to matter in practice.
///     Same screen, same per-hero navigation, so gear and jewels are handled in one pass per hero
///     instead of two separate tasks re-walking the whole roster.
///     No tier-unlock action exists for jewels (checked twice, both view modes) - only a locked-tier
///     placeholder with no button, unlike gear/soulstones. Soulstones (tier-unlock and enchant, same
///     shape as gear) confirmed present but explicitly deferred by the user to a future task
///     (level 200+).
